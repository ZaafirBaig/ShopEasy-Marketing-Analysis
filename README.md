# ShopEasy Marketing Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews and marketing performance data for **ShopEasy**, an online retail business. The goal was to identify key insights into customer sentiment, engagement, and conversion rates to help the business optimize its marketing strategies.

The project involved the use of SQL for data extraction, Python for sentiment analysis, and Power BI for data visualization.

## Key Components

### 1. SQL Data Extraction
SQL was used to retrieve customer review data from the ShopEasy database. This data included customer reviews, product ratings, and other relevant fields necessary for further analysis.

- **Technologies Used**: SQL Server, pyodbc, Pandas

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
Python's **VADER Sentiment Analysis** tool was applied to categorize customer reviews as positive, negative, or mixed, based on the review text and product ratings. Sentiment scores were also bucketed to better understand the intensity of the sentiments.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLTK (VADER), Pandas

### 3. Power BI Data Model & Dashboards
The cleaned and processed data was used to create an integrated data model in **Power BI**. From this model, I built multiple interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics such as customer sentiment, conversion funnel stages, and marketing performance.

### 4. Final Report
A comprehensive report summarizing key findings and recommendations for improving ShopEasyâ€™s marketing strategies.

- **Technologies Used**: Power BI, SQL, Python

## Insights & Findings

- **Customer Sentiment**: A significant number of negative reviews pointed to issues with customer support and shipping delays.
- **Conversion Drop-off**: The majority of potential customers abandoned their purchases at the checkout stage, signaling a need for optimizing the checkout process.
- **Marketing ROI**: Some of the higher-budget campaigns failed to deliver proportional returns, indicating that more cost-effective strategies may yield better engagement.
